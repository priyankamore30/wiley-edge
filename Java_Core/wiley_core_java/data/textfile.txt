This class is used 
for reading and writing
 to random access file. A random access file behaves
  like a large array of bytes. 
  There is a cursor
   implied to the array called file
   
    pointer, by moving the cursor 
    we do the read write operations. 
    
   If end-of-file is reached before the 
   desired number of byte has been read than 
EOFException is thrown. It is a type of IOException.
